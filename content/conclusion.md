# Conclusions
<br/>
**Descriptive statistics are a useful tool to understand, share, and investigate your data, both numerically and visually.**

If you are interested in learning more on coding in R, we offer a number of workshops throughout the year: [Workshops](https://researchcommons.library.ubc.ca/workshops/)

We also offer one-on-one consulations for solutions to specific challenged you are facing: [Consultations](https://researchcommons.library.ubc.ca/consultation-requests/)

We now have an optional 30 minute question period if you want to learn more or continue practicing.
