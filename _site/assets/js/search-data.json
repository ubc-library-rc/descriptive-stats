They allow you to describe and visualize your data to better understand them, preliminarily investigate patterns and relationships, and inform statistical analyses. The most common examples of these include statistics like mean, median, interquartile range, and more. We will be going through these . These statistics can concisely describe aspects of your data to inform your own work and to share information about your data with others. Bhandari, P. (2023, January 09). Descriptive Statistics.
